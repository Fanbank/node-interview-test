# Plink Node Coding Test

You'll need to clone this repo locally so that you and your future teammates can work through some issues and make improvements to the code together.

Feel free to ask questions or consult any internet resources. The goal is to see how you work and how well we all work together.

## 1. Explore the DB

Use the database credentials provided to explore the structure of the test database. We'll need to whitelist your IP address in order for you to access the database from your local machine.

## 2. Create a new route

Create a new route that queries the db and returns the businesses and their associated stores.

## 3. Test your route

Write an automated test to validate the new route works as expected.
